Behavior of the cost function and accuracy for the standard model and the model using ensemble.
We call it U_linear when we use the parameterization where the CNOT gates could act between neighboring pairs of qubits and we call it U_all when the CNOT gate was applied to all pairs of qubits

Using the minist dataset with only images of 0 and 1. 2000 images of each were used for training and 200 of each for testing
dataSet1 --> data generated when using parameterization with CNOT applied to pairs of neighboring qubits
dataSet2 --> data generated when using parameterization with CNOT applied to all qubit pairs

Using the minist dataset with only images of 0, 1 and 2. 2000 images of each were used for training and 200 of each for testing
dataSet3 --> data generated when using parameterization with CNOT applied to pairs of neighboring qubits
dataSet4 --> data generated when using parameterization with CNOT applied to all qubit pairs
