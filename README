In this repository we present the data and codes used in the article "Quantum neural network with ensemble learning to mitigate barren plateaus and cost function concentration". In this work we analyze how we can use the method known as ensemble learning to build a quantum neural network capable of mitigating the barren plateaus problem and the cost function concentration problem.
